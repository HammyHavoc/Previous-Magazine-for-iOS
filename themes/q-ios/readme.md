# Theme's Overview

## What's implemented
At the moment, Q for iOS theme implements:
* A clean iOS UI (including transitions)
* Off-canvas menu (you can update it in the app's edit panel)
* Archive template (eg. post list) with infinite post list
* Single template (eg. a post) with the most common HTML elements (eg. strong, em, blockquote...)
* Responsive embeds
* The refresh process
* Offline cache (meaning that you can read loaded posts offline)
* Post thumbnail captions and subhead support
* The iOS back button
* The iOS status bar 
* A responsive interface

## iOS UI
* Back button when displaying the single view (ie. a post)
* In app browser to open external links
* Status bar color matches the theme
* iOS spinner

## Cordova Plugins
Q for iOS relies on Cordova plugins to:
* Customize the iOS status bar: [https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-statusbar)
* Open external links in an in app browser: [https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser)

WP-AppKit export function adds these plugins automatically to your *config.xml* file. If you don't use the export, make sure to add them in order the theme to be able to work properly.

## Responsive Images
Q for iOS hooks into the WP-AppKit web services to modify the source code of images in the post content. It eases the way to style the responsive images later. See *prepare-content.php* in the *php* folder of the themes.

## Thumbnail Captions and Subheads
Q for iOS hooks into the WP-AppKit web services to modify add thumbnail captions and subheads (if available) in the post content. See *add-custom-data.php* in the *php* folder of the themes. Note that subheads are expected as a post custom field.
